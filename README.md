# quote_api
Work In Progress improvement of a Codecademy challenge project

I am trying to implement a delete method which has the following features:
  1. has its own html page
  2. removes quotes by ID from the quotes array
  3. returns a confirmation message with the quote that has been deleted 
    -or- returns an error message if a quote with the submitted ID does not exist.
    
The project functions except the Delete Quote page returns the quote following the deleted quote, not the actual deleted quote.
